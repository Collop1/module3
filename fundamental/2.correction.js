let three = "3"

//what is the value of the following expressions? 
let addition = three + four 
let multiplication = three * four 
let division = three / four 
let subtraction = three - four 

let lessThan1 = three < four 
let lessThan2 = thirty < four // This is returning true because we are using strings and strings use the first letter to determine if it's bigger or smaller. We can use numbers to resolve this
